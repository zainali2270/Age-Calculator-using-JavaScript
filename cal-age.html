Different cultures have different ways of calculating a person's age. A common age system is used in the calculation of this calculator's results. In this system, the age increases with the birthday of the individual. If a person has lived for 3 years and 11 months, his/her age is 3, and he/she will turn 4 on his/her next birthday, which is one month from now. This age system is used in most western countries.


In some cultures, age is indicated by counting years, including or excluding the current year, and some civilizations do not count years. 20-year-olds are equivalent to 21-year-olds, for example. Tradition has it that people in China are born at one year old and their ages increase at the Traditional Chinese New Year instead of their birthdays. As an example, if a baby was born two days before the Chinese New Year, he or she will be two years old while being only two days old.

If the beginning date is at the end of a month, the months and days output of this age calculator may be perplexing. Example: February 20 through March 20 is considered one month by everyone. To determine the age from February 28, 2015 to March 31, 2015, there are two ways to do it. Because 28 February to 28 March is one month, the answer is one month and three days. 28 February and 31 March are considered the end of the month if both dates are considered. Both outcomes of the calculations appear to be valid. Dates such as April 30 to May 31, June 30 to July 30, etc., are also affected. The inconsistency in the number of days in various months is to blame. In our calculations, the following factors were taken into account.
